Interaction in virtual reality (VR) environments is essential to achieve a pleasant and immersive experience. Most of the currently existing VR applications, lack of a robust object grasping and manipulation system, which is the cornerstone of any interaction system. Therefore, we propose a realistic, ﬂexible and robust grasping system that enables rich and real-time interactions in virtual environments. It is visually realistic because it is completely user-controlled, ﬂexible because it can be used for diﬀerent hand conﬁgurations, and robust because it allows the manipulation of objects regardless their geometry, i.e. hand is automatically ﬁtted to the object shape. In order to validate our proposal, an exhaustive qualitative and quantitative performance analysis has been carried out. On the one hand, qualitative evaluation was used in the assessment of abstract aspects such as: hands movement realism, interaction realism and motor control. On the other hand, for the quantitative evaluation a novel error metric has been proposed to visually analyze the performed grips. This metric is based on the computation of the distance from the ﬁnger phalanges to nearest contact point on the object surface. These contact points can be used with application purposes mainly in the ﬁeld of robotics. As a conclusion, system evaluation reports a similar performance between users with previous experience in virtual reality applications and inexperienced users, referring to a steep learning curve.



In the following video we can observe the quantitative evaluation where we smoothly interact with objects from the YCB dataset:
